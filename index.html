                <p>Sadly, I didn't think this code up from scratch cause I know basically nothing about HTML, but I did write it entirely so hopefuly that makes up for that.

                    In the past few months that I've gotten to know you, I've learnt about how kind and sweet you are. Weâ€™ve had a lot of fun talks, and slightly awkward moments but I find them all (and you) very charming.    
                    Anyways, I hope this card puts a smile on your face and hopefully make your day a little bit better. 
                    <br><br>
                    May all your wishes come true :D</p>
